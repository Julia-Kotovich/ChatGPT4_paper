This fold contains questions and answers relative to Behavioral design patterns, i.e., Mediator and Observer.

Since the series of questions were repeated three times, the question ID and file's name indicate the pattern's name and the attempt no. For example, Mediator_ChatGPT01 - Attempt No. 1_3.pdf means these experimental results are obtained from ChatGPT and are related to the Mediator design pattern and it is from attempt no. 1 out of 3. 
The same code structure is also used for folders containing software quality analysis results.
