This fold contains questions and answers relative to creational design patterns, i.e., Singleton and Abstract Factory.

Since the series of questions were repeated three times, the question ID and file's name indicate the pattern's name and the attempt no. For example Singleton_ChatGPT01 - Attempt No. 1_3.pdf means these experimental results are related to the Singleton design pattern and it is from attempt no. 1 out of 3. 
The same code structure is also used for folders containing software quality analysis results.
